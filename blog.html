                <span>1. Difference Between Local Storage and Session Storage.</span>
                <p>The Difference between Local Storage and Session Storage is that local storage data does not expire,
                    whereas session storage data is clear when the page session ends.</p>
                <p>The storage capacity of local storage and session storage is 5MB and 10MB respectively.</p>
                <p>As Local Storage not session-based, it must be deleted via JavaScript or manually and Session Storage
                    session-based and works per window/tab.</p>

                <span>2. Difference Between Global Scope and Block Scope.</span>
                <p class="title">Global Scope</p>
                <p class="Snd-ans">The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global
                    variables and have global scope. Global Scope Means that the variables can be accessed from any part
                    of that program, any functional or conditional state can access that variable.</p>
                <p class="title">Block Scope</p>
                <p class="Snd-ans">Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the
                    scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or
                    conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from
                    within the curly brackets {}.</p>

                <span>3. How Does JavaScript Event Loop Works?</span>
                <p>The Event Loop has one simple job to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack
                    is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call
                    Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>

                <span>4. When We Get Undefined?</span>

                <p class="Snd-ans">When we try to access a uninitialized variable.</p>
                <p class="Snd-ans">When we write a function but not return.</p>
                <p class="Snd-ans">When we write a function but not pass the parameter.</p>
                <p class="Snd-ans">When we want to access a object as the property not in the object</p>
