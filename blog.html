                <span>1. Difference Between Local Storage and Session Storage.</span>
                <p>The Difference between Local Storage and Session Storage is that local storage data does not expire, whereas session storage data is clear when the page session ends.</p>
                <p>The storage capacity of local storage and session storage is 5MB and 10MB respectively.</p>
                <p>As Local Storage not session-based, it must be deleted via JavaScript or manually and Session Storage session-based and works per window/tab.</p>

                <span>2. Difference Between Global Scope and Block Scope.</span>
                <p class="title">Global Scope</p>
                <p class="Snd-ans">The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global Scope Means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any functional or conditional state can access that variable.</p>
                <p class="title">Block Scope</p>
                <p class="Snd-ans">Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.</p>
